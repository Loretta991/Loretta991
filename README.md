# 🔍 Proof-of-Concept AI Projects – by Elle Grey

**"I showcase how I think by building proof-of-concept solutions *before* the interview — not after."**

This repo contains hands-on demos I've built in response to real job descriptions and technical prompts. Each folder highlights how I tackle tasks in:
- Prompt Engineering
- QA + Fallback Testing for LLMs
- Data Visualization
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Front-end Integration with React + Colab

Explore the folders below to see how I solve problems before the job offer arrives.
